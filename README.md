## Blood Donations 
*Currently on Version 2*  
A classification problem - trying to predict if a donor will donate blood "this month." Inspired by the Iris code, I implemented a implmemented the cross-validated classifier also to this project, with much improved results currently the precision is 0.72 and recall is 0.46. Still not perfect.  


## Iris
Using the clasic iris classification data, I got inspired online to implement a crossvalidation of multiple classifiers.
