A collection of Python Data Projects

## Blood Donations 
*Currently on Version 2*  
A classification problem - tryign to predict if a donor will donate bloow "this month." Inspired by the Iric code, I implemented a implmemented the cross-validated classifier also to this project, with much improved results currently the precision is 0.72 and recall is 0.46. Still not perfect.  
Version 3 will ofus on more careful data cleaning and preparation

## Iris
Using the clasic iris classification data, I got inspired online to implement a crossvalidation of multiple classifiers.
