## Blood Donations 
Predicting blood donations using three classificaiton methods: Logistic regression, Gradient Descent, and ADA Boost
### Version 2
After messing with the Iris dataset, I implmemented the cross-validated classifier also on the blood donation data, with much improved results. Version 3 will improve this further by fixing variable distributions.

## Iris
Using the clasic iris classification data, I got inspired online to implement a crossvalidation of multiple classifiers.
