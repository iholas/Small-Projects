Idea from: [Driven Data](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/2/)

Implementing three classification methods to predict blood donation
1) simple lgistic regression
2) Stochaistic Gradient Descent Classifier
3) ADA Boosted Decision Tree Classifier 

Currently the SGDC method is very lousy, must try to improve.  
Logistic regression has decent accuracy (~0.76), but poor recall (0.1).   
ADABoost Classifier has good Accuracy (~0.81), but still sub 0.5 recall.
